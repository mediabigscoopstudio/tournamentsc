"""Root URL configuration for TournamentSC.

Two applications, four isolated route namespaces:

    /                 public audience site        — no authentication, ever
    /player/…         player application          — /player/login
    /organizer/…      organizer application       — /organizer/login
    /dashboard/…      platform-admin application  — /dashboard/login

Include order matters. `accounts` claims the auth doors first, `tournaments`
claims the organizer + player action routes, `dash` owns the whole admin console,
and `main` serves the public site last. No pattern sits at the bare URL root
except the public pages themselves, so an organizer or admin route can never be
shadowed by a tournament slug.

Django's built-in admin is not installed by default and is never routed on a
guessable path.
